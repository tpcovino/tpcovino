- Hi - I'm Tim Covino
- I am currently an associate professor working on issues of land cover impacts on watershed processes in the western US
- Work in my lab is largely focused on forest cover change as a result of wildfire or timber harvest and how this influences the movement of water and solutes across the landscape
